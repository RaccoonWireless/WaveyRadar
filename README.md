 Continous-Wave Multi-Modulation Radar Expermentation Platform 

This compact (80mm x 40mm) platform is designed to allow researchers to experiment with various 6GHz radar designs. The system includes following RF components and respective functionalities: 

- `ADF4159` PLL with 1.23MHz loop filter provides frequency ramping/modulation in sawtooth, triangle, or FSK formats. 
- `ADL5375` IQ Modulator provides phase/amplitude modulation.
- `AD9106` DAC/DDS provides waveform generation for aforementioned modulator on both I/Q channels. 
- `HMC951A` IQ Downconverter allows for analysis of received radar signals.
- `RFSW6024`* RF Switch provides selection of either the unmodulated carrier frequency generated by the PLL or the sampled modulated transmitted signal to be fed into the LO input of the aforementioned downconverter. 
\*`HMC849A` used prior to revision 2. 

Other features include:
- Built in Tx and Rx microstrip patch antennas with inline SW23 RF switches/probes for bypassing to external antennas. 
- `Cortex M0+`* Microcontroller for digital control of PLL, DAC, and RF bypass switch. Accessible through USB C interface. 
- Wide 12-20V input voltage range with input protections.
- M2 mounting holes.
\*Not present prior to revision 2. 

These features are built onto a high-frequency PCB material using RF-design techniques.
